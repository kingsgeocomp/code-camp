    "## The Fall and Rise of Geocomputation\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a world transformed by big (geo)data: from Facebook likes and satellites, to travel cards and drones, the process of collecting and analysing data about the world around us is becoming very, very cheap. Twenty years ago, gathering data about the human and physical environment was expensive, but now a lot of it is generated as the ‘exhaust’ of day-to-day activity: tapping on to the bus or train, taking photos (whether from a satellite, drone, or disposable camera), making phone calls, using our credit cards, and surfing the web. And that's before you start looking at the Terabytes of data being generated by satellites, air quality and river flow sensors, and other Earth Observation Systems! \n",
    "\n",
    "As the costs of capturing, curating, and processing these data sets falls, the discipline of geography is changing. You face a world in which many of the defining career options for geographers with basic quantitative skills will either no longer exist, or will have been seriously de-skilled. So much can now be done through a web browser (e.g. [CartoDB](https://carto.com)) that specifying ‘Knowledge of ArcGIS’ is becoming superfluous; not because geo-analysis jobs are no longer in demand or no longer done -- in fact, they are more vital than ever -- but because the market for these skills has split in two: expensive, specialist software is being superseded by simple, non-specialist web-based tools on the ‘basic’ side, and by customised code on the 'advanced' side.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for these reasons that terms like 'geocomputation', 'computational geography' and 'geographic data science' are back in vogue. After a period in which GIS was front-and-centre for many geographers with an interest in spatial data (as well for many geographers who objected to the shortcomings of quantitative approaches), the availability of data and advanced computational techniques (including Machine Learning), together with the 'discovery' by other disciplines of the role of geography in 'big data' processes, has created a need for a 'new' (or old, depending on your view) type of geographer able to reason much more directly _through_ code while remaining rooted in the critical geographic tradition that is aware of the short-comings (and opportunities) of data."

    "\n",
    "For example, we can see Alex Singleton’s OpenAtlas for Camden [Camden Open Atlas](https://opendata.camden.gov.uk/People-Places/2011-Census-Open-Atlas-Camden/jiah-9evi). Alex designed and wrote a script to _iterate_ over the Census areas (i.e. to ‘visit’ each area in turn when creating a map), and to _recurse_ into smaller sub-regions from larger regions (i.e. to keep drilling down into smaller and smaller geographies) in order to generate maps at, literally, every conceivable scale. Then he let the computer do the ‘boring bit’ of actually creating each and every map. "

    "### Thinking Algorithmically\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking _algorithmically_ requires students and professionals to deal with abstraction: we don’t want to define how each analysis should work – or how each map should look – rather, we want to specify a set of rules about how to select and display data on a map, and then let the computer make them all for us. In this way of working it’s not really any more work to create 500 or 5,000 maps than it is to create 5 because we’ve already told the computer how to make useful maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another way to think about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _An algorithm is like a recipe. It takes \"inputs\" (the ingredients), performs a set of simple and (hopefully) well-defined steps, and then terminates after producing an \"output\" (the meal)._\n",
    "\n",
    "This article also goes on to make some interesting points about AI and deep learning that are [well worth a read](https://medium.com/@geomblog/when-an-algorithm-isn-t-2b9fe01b9bb5), but for our purposes, the bit about a *recipe* is the important bit: how would you break your problem down into steps *like the ones you'd see for a recipe*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to think this way is *hard work*: the *first* time I try a new recipe I really don't know how things are going to taste. Similarly, the first time I use an algorithm to make a map or solve a problem I usually don't actually know exactly how my maps are going to look until _after_ I've made them. The difference from the 'normal', non-computational way of working is that I make a few changes to my code and then just run it again. And again... as many times as I need to in order to get what I want. I can keep changing the recipe until I get it just right."

    "\n",
    "However, trying the same recipe again and again and again _also_ sounds like hard work! Wouldn't it be faster to just click and choose what you want the computer to do in SPSS or ArcMap? Well, yes and no. The two advantages to doing this with code over pointing-and-clicking are: 1) your solution is _transferrable_; and 2) thinking 'like a programmer' is also about problem-solving, and that _also_ transfers very nicely to the 'real world' of employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we say this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Programming solutions are transferrable because you aren't just solving _one_ problem, you are solving _classes_ of problems. In the same way that many recipes build on the same basic ingredients (sometimes adding something new for added 'spice'), many applications use the same basic ingredients: it's how they're put together in new ways that lead to new outputs. It's a lot like Lego.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thinking like a programmer also translates well because you are learning to deal with abstraction. Yes, the details of a problem matter (just as ignoring cultural differences between two countries can matter), but it's important to be able to break a really big, messy, complex problem down into smaller, tidier, more comprehensible bits that you _can_ tackle. Programmers deal with this every day, so they tend to develop important skills in understanding and dealing with practical challenges of the sort that you'll face every day in your career.\n",

    "2. Plan -- if you just dive in without thinking about what you need your code to take in and spit out then you're going to waste a _lot_ of time.\n",
    "3. Divide -- break a hard problem down into simple, small steps and tackle them in small, simple blocks of code. _Never_ try to just sit down and 'code'.\n",
    "4. Debug with a fresh eye -- if you really feel stuck, step away from the computer for 5 minutes, take a deep breath, and try to look at the problem with a fresh set of eyes rather than just diving back in. Most problems boil down to either not seeing the big picture, or not realising that the computer is doing _exactly what you told it to do_, and _not what you meant for it to do_.\n",
    "5. Practice -- find ways to practice problem-solving and coding (not necessarily at the same time).\n",

    "## The Benefits of Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a practical context we think that the benefits of learning to code fall into three categories:\n",
    "1. **Flexibility**: a computer can often apply the _same_ analytical process to a completely different data set (_e.g._ rainfall in UK vs rainfall in the US) with minimal effort compared to trying to do each step manually in, say, Excel or SPSS. For students, it comes down to this: if you discover a newer, better data set halfway through your dissertation and want to use this for your analysis instead of the old, inaccurate data, it's a lot easier and faster to update your analyses if you have used code to do the analysis to-date!\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: recently, it's been discovered that a lot of research cannot be reproduced. In other words, if one scientist tries to duplicate what someone else did in order to check something out (as is important in the scientific method) they're finding that the results don't line up. So a second example of why coding your data analysis for a dissertation: you've just finished your analysis when someone points out that you made a mistake with the data right back at the beginning; redoing all of that in Excel or SPSS would be a nightmare, but with code, it can be as easy as changing one line and hitting 'Run'!\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: a computer doesn't care if you throw 10 lines or 10 billion lines at it, the only thing that changes is how long it takes to get an answer. In other words, if your code 'works' on a subset of your data it should also work on your entire data set no matter how big it is. This is also a good way to develop code: rather than try to read in the whole data set in one go while you're still trying to understand it, take a few rows and make sure you're handling _those_ ones correctly (and if what you see squares with what you were told) before expanding to larger and larger subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the payoff for coding the answer to a problem instead of just clicking through the options in SPSS or Arc can seem a long way away. It's like learning a new language: you spend a lot of time asking directions to the train station or whether someone had a nice breakfast before you can start work on the novel or the business case. But the payoff _is_ there if you stick with it!"

    "## The 3 virtues of a programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful idea comes from [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (the man with the strong 'tache game below!), who created a programming language called Perl. Larry said that programmers had three virtues: **Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cdn.quotationof.com/images/larry-wall-1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons that these are virtues in programming (but not in your studies!) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Laziness** makes you want to put in the effort _now_ to reduce the amount of effort you'll have to put in _later_. It might be a lot of work to produce a map of _one_ US State automatically using code, but once you've worked out how to do it for one state, then you've also figured out how to do it for _all 50_! That is useful laziness.\n",
    "2. **Hubris** makes you want to write code that other people won't want to \"say bad things about\". Over time you'll come to understand more intuitively what makes 'good' code in more detail (and we cover it a bit in the last notebook), but the short version is: it's efficient, it's easy to read, and it's clever.\n",
    "3. **Impatience** is about wanting the answer _now_ and looking for ways to get _there_ as quickly as possible. Being impatient doesn't mean just jumping into writing code, it means that you _first_ look too see whether and how other people have solved similar problems before starting work on your own code. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we try to stand on the shoulder of giants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint_**: you'll see a lot of laziness when you start trying to write code. Programmers don't like writing **`remove`** when they could just write **`rm`**, nor do they like writing **`define`** when they could just write **`def`**. Keep an eye out for these mnemonics as they can be pretty daunting at first."

    "### The 3 false virtues\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry also pointed out that these virtues had three mirror-image false virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **False laziness** happens when you leave something working but half-finished and, most likely, about to break. When you start using [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) you may find that it makes it easy to copy+paste answers into your notebook and then you can glue it together messily. This isn't the same as _understanding_ and _adapting_ the solution that you found online to _your_ problem, so it's false laziness. To really develop a learning mindset, [don't copy+paste code, type it out](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-benefits-of-typing-instead-of-copying-54ed734ad849#.es5mw1j0z). \n",
    "2. **False hubris** is thinking that no one else's code is 'good enough' for you. Sometimes copy+paste is false laziness, but refusing to recognise when copy+paste (or importing a library, more on this later) _is_ the right thing to do is false hubris.\n",
    "3. **False impatience** is getting started on coding your answer to a problem when you don't yet understand what the problem actually _is_. One thing that a lot of programmers do is half-listen to what someone has asked them to do and then go haring off without sitting down to make any kind of plan. It's like writing an essay without having done the readings. Nudge, nudge.\n",

But just as your French- or Chinese-speaking friends will get tried of answering your questions if you don't make it obvious that you're working _hard_ to learn, most programmers won't be very impressed if you just ask for 'the answer' and then come back two days later with the _same question_."

It's the same for programming: the reason you got a 'silly' answer is that we haven't taught you how to ask the right question yet! For a language like Python \"`4`\" is not always the same as \"`4.0`\"... and sometimes the way ahead is unclear, but don't worry if you can't get the right answer _yet_, how to 'talk numbers' is the main topic in the _next_ notebook and we'll show you the answer at the end of this notebook.\n",

Your lecturers and instructors _frequently_ still ask for help (often by asking Google!), it's just that we do it for harder questions. And that's only because we have had a lot more practice in the language of programming. So the _only_ silly thing you can do in this course is to assume that you can speed through the questions and don't have to practice or think through the technical aspects of coding. \n",

Depending on the question we might: give you the answer and explain why it's the answer; give you a really annoying _partial_ answer because it's something that we want you to figure out for yourself; or say \"That's a really tough question, we'll have to look up the answer\".

    "### Python vs R\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside Python, the other language that is often mentioned by people doing data-led research is [R](https://www.r-project.org). It's the _other_ one that many of your lecturers and a lot of other scientists use in a lot of their work.  There's [a great deal of debate about the relative merits of Python and R](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-data-analysis-R-or-Python), but for our purposes, _both_ Python and R can help us to undertake the geographical analysis. That is, in fact, the premise of this entire course! \n",
    "\n",
    "So why have we chosen to use Python here? Of the two languages, we think that Python has some specific advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It was designed for teaching, so its syntax is easier for a human to 'parse' than R's\n",
    "2. It is more _like_ other languages, so it is more readily transferrable if you need to learn another language. Think of it as learning Italian, which also makes it easier to learn Spanish and French.\n",
    "3. It is the one most-used as part of a *geographical workflow* – what we mean by this is that you can find Python buried inside of ESRI's ArcGIS and the open-source QGIS applications, and it also sits behind (or talks to) a number of other tools that allow us to work flexibly and scalably with geo-data. \n",
    "4. It is easier to operationalise – Python offers more services/tools to enable you to turn something from a 'hack' ([which doesn't mean what you think it means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) into a 'service'.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have been told R is the way to go then don't worry, the concepts covered here still translate. And many of the contributors to these notebooks use both languages... it just depends on the problem. "

    "### Python what?\n",
    "Python was invented by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the late 1980s and he continues in the role of 'benevolent dictator' to this day, which means that he (and some other very smart people) try to ensure that the language continues to meet the basic goals of:\n",
    "* Being very easy to read (syntax)\n",
    "* Using plain-English for many functions and operators (allowed words)\n",
    "* Has a comprehensive style guide: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (syntax)\n",
    "* Has no unnecessary special formatting characters (syntax _and_ allowed words)\n",
    "\n",
    "So while Python is not a language that enables the computer to make calculations the fastest (C and C++ are faster), nor is it the safest (you wouldn't use it to fly a rocket to Mars), it _is_ a very readable, learnable and maintainable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to learn to code, to do 'data science', or build a business, Python is a great choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The points above are also made in [Python In A Nutshell](http://mbrochh.github.io/python-101/#/6/1) by [Martin Brochhaus](https://github.com/mbrochh) which you may find interesting and useful to accompany your learning of Python."

    "- Doing _exactly_ what they are told to do\n",

    "What are computers currently still bad at?\n",

    "- Being creative\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a long-standing contest, called the Turing Test in honour of [the famous computer pioneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), that demonstrates this difference rather nicely: a computer passes the Turing test if it can fool a person into thinking that they're talking to another person. Some people have claimed that if a computer can _really_ pass the Turing Test by keeping up a conversation of indefinite length on any range of topics then we'll have to declare that machines have become full AIs (Artificial Intelligences). To put it another way: if it sounds like a human and responds like a human... then is it a human?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps fortunately for us, although computers are getting a lot better at holding up their end of the conversation they still seem to have a hard time fooling anyone for very long. In contrast, bigger and better computers have now beat the best humans at Chess and Go, and are being used to help us understand earthquakes and climate change on a huge scale. Here, computers can do billions -- or trillions -- of calculations a second to work out that if 'A' happens then 'B' is the next most likely thing to happen, and so on and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that games like Go and Chess have well-understood rules as (ultimately) do natural processes like climate change and earthquakes. Chess is 'easier' for a computer than Go because a big enough computer can work out every possible chess move and pick the best one, whereas it can't do that for Go and so has to make 'choices' based on incomplete information. Earthquakes have even more 'rules', but as far we know they still follow _some_ set of rules dictated by physics and chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "People, however, don't use the same unchanging rules in conversation. Yes, conversations have norms, unless you're using an online comment forum where it's normal to start a conversation by asking someone if they're an idiot, but people don't just 'play games' within the rules, they actually play with the rules themselves in a way that computers find very, very hard to follow. Think of sarcasm: you say one thing but it means exactly the opposite. And if it's delivered deadpan then sometimes even people have trouble knowing if you're being sincere!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why AI of the sort you might have seen in _2001_ or _Blade Runner_ has been twenty years away for the last sixty years! Recently, computers have been getting better and better at doing really difficult things, but it's usually still in a narrow area where we understand the rules and we normally need to spend a lot of time training the computer. \n",
