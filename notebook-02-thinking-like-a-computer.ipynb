    "\n",
    "In order to understand how to _program_ a computer, it helps to learn how to _think_ like a computer. At least a little bit. A lot of what we do in programming strips back the veneer of point-and-click friendliness of OSX or Windows so that we can interact with the computer in ways that require much less human input. The world will seem a bit less friendly in the short term, but you will gain the ability to work much more quickly and powerfully with the computer through code."

In fact, you will see that we've used code to import the YouTube video in a way that requires me to do very little work and this is one of the strengths of programming: that someone else created the code to embed a YouTube video into a notebook (which is what this web page is) and all I need to do is know how to ask that code to find the video on the YouTube web site.

When these rules become sufficiently complex (they become like long recipes!) they are called algorithms. And when they get so complicated that they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have [programming languages](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/proglang.htm).\n",

It's much easier to have two folders -- `raw` or `source`, and `clean` or `output` -- and use Python to read in raw data from one directory and then write the processed data out to a different directory than it would be using Excel's `File > Save As`. That's because the path is just _text_ and you can easily work with it that way!\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of terminology: any path that starts with a `/` is an _**absolute path**_ because we are starting from the _**root**_ directory; any path that starts with either `..` or `.` is a _**relative path**_ because it is starting from the _**current**_ directory and is relative to where the Terminal or program 'is' now.\n",

    "If you remember that on a Unix/Mac we use `\\` to manage things like spaces in a directory name then you can see how it gets pretty confusing and complicated pretty quickly when you start to program...

Let's revisit some of the commeands we've just seen:\n",

    "| pwd | print working directory | Show the path of the current current directory (_i.e._ where am I now?) |\n",
    "| head | Get the head of a file | Print the first few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `head somefile.csv`) |\n",
    "| tail | Get the tail of a file | Print the last few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `tail -n 2 somefile.csv`) |\n",

    "| exit | Exit the Terminal | To close an open Terminal window |\n",
