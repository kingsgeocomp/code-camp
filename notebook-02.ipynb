    "In order to understand how to _program_ a computer it helps to learn how to _think_ like a computer. At least a little bit. A lot of what we do in programming strips back the veneer of point-and-click friendliness of OSX or Windows so that we can interact with the computer in ways that require much less human input. The world will seem a bit less friendly in the short term, but you will gain the ability to work much more quickly and powerfully with the computer through code."

In fact, you will see that we've used code to import the YouTube video in a way that requires me to do very little work and this is one of the strengths of programming: that someone else created the code to embed a YouTube video into a notebook (which is what this web page is) and all I need to do is know how to ask that code to find the video on the YouTube web site.

When these rules become sufficiently complex (they become like long recipes!) they are called algorithms. And when they get so complicated that they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have [programming languages](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/proglang.htm).\n",

That's because when you are programming you will need to give the computer a lot more information about how to find, read, and write data. When you used an app on your mobile phone or on your computer it will often save your files somewhere convenient so that you can find them again, but this isn't magic: a programmer made a choice about how to do this for you, now that you're learning to program _you_ have to make that choice."

Here's a simple example that you can run (probably only on Mac or Linux machine) either in the Terminal or using the Terminal launched from JupyterLab:\n",

    "\n",
    "This might seem a little strange but we can break this problem down into steps (as I did when trying to remember how to do it!):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `curl` -- this is a tool (hopefully installed on your computer!) that allows you to download a file from the internet using only the Terminal.\n",
    "2. `head` -- this utility works with the _top_ part of a file (`tail` starts working with the _end_ of a file)\n",
    "3. We 'glue' the output of `curl` together with `head` using `|` (known as a 'pipe') -- this tells the computer to pass the output of `curl` to the input of `head` (so head sees this as a file).\n",
    "4. `head -1` means 'take only the _first_ line of the file (so `head -10` would take the first _ten_ lines of the file).\n",
    "5. We then direct the output of `head` to a file called `Header.csv` using the redirection command `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this one line of _code_ allows you to download a file, extract the first line of the file (so that we can see what the variables are!), and then write it to a file on the local computer. Assuming that you didn't see any errors, you should now have a file called `Header.csv` and can see for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this is that we are gaining in power at the cost of a little 'ease of use'. Doing this _without_ using code would require: navigating to the web page, clicking the link to download the file, opening the file in a text editor or Excel, selecting and copying the first line, and then opening a new file, pasting in the copied data, and saving the file with a name and location!

    "Two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because you will need to think _logically_ and in an _organised_ way about how you manage data when you start doing data analysis: you will almost never receive raw data that doesn't require some work; so if you save your raw data and your processed data in the same directory how can you be sure you've loaded the right file? It's much easier to have two folders -- `raw` or `source`, and `clean` or `output` -- and use Python to read in raw data from one directory and then write the processed data out to a different directory than it would be using Excel's `File > Save As`. That's because the path is just _text_ and you can easily work with it that way!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because once you've learned how to use the path on your _own_ computer, you can use the _same_ techniques to navigate a web server or computer on the other side of the planet using URLs (which are just paths with some special 'sauce' that tell Python that the file it needs isn't on this computer).\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of terminology: any path that starts with a `/` is an _**absolute path**_ because we are starting from the _**root**_ directory; any path that starts with either `..` or `.` is a _**relative path**_ because it is starting from the _**current**_ directory and is relative to where the Terminal or program 'is' now.\n",

    "That's quite a lot of new content to get your head around, so you might want to spend some time exploring your own computer using the Terminal (Shell/Power Shell on Windows) to get the hang of how paths work. All you'll need are: `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` (or [their Windows equivalents](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/ap-doslinux.html) and [here for more](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse140/13wi/shell-usage.html#windows)) to get started!"

    "You might recall that we previously said that [all programmers are lazy](notebook-1.ipynb), and understanding this laziness is the key to thinking that most Terminal (and Python) commands look like the result of monkeys hitting keys at random to being able to write code without constantly having to check Google. Let's revisit some of the commeands we've just seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Short For... | What It Does |\n",
    "|:------- |:------------ |:------------ |\n",
    "| ls | list | List the contents of the directory I'm about to give you ('`ls ~`' lists the contents of your home directory; '`ls ..`' lists the contents of the parent directory; etc.) |\n",
    "| cd | change directory | Move to the path I'm about to give you ('`cd ~`' moves you to your home directory; '`cd ..`' moves you to the parent directory; etc.) | \n",
    "| pwd | print working directory | Show the path of the current current directory (_i.e._ where am I now?) |\n",
    "| head | Get the head of a file | Print the first few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `head somefile.csv`) |\n",
    "| tail | Get the tail of a file | Print the last few lines of the specified file (_e.g._ `tail -n 2 somefile.csv`) |\n",
    "| clear | Clear the Terminal | When the Terminal looks really busy with junk you don't need just type `clear` |\n",
    "| exit | Exit the Terminal | To close an open Terminal window |\n",
    "| mv | Move a directory or file | Like dragging things in the Finder window (_e.g._ `mv somefile.csv ../another_dir/` to move the file `somefile.csv` _over_ to a directory named `another_dir` that is accessible from the parent directory of this one) |\n",
    "| cp | Copy a directory or file | Like dragging things in the Finder window (_e.g._ `cp somefile.csv ../another_dir/` to make a copy of the file `somefile.csv` in a directory named `another_dir` that is accessible from the parent directory of this one) |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how all of these commands are basically abbreviations/mnemonics that make it easy for programmers to be lazy, but productive: less time typing == more time thinking/doing."
