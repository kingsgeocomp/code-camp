    "Welcome to the third Code Camp notebook! This lesson is all about learning to deal with the (unavoidable) errors that you wil encounter when programming in Ptyhon. Most programmers spend _most_ of their day dealing with errors of one sort or another: sometimes they are easy to solve (e.g. you mis-typed a variable name), other times they are very, very hard (e.g. you are writing a cloud computing platform and have to deal with competition for resources). Either way, learning how to find, diagnose, and resolve errors, as well as how to minimize their consequences, is thus a crucial skill for programmers. \n",

In other words, it can read what you've typed but it doesn't quite make sense.\n",

Many English-speakers who are 'embarassed' by their level of Spanish are also apparently happy to inform Spanish-speakers that they are pregnant ('embarazada')! Or perhaps you think that the opposite of 'regardless' is 'irregardless'? These are natural mistakes, but they are 'errors' nonetheless. It's just that human beings – being smart – can figure out what you meant, while computers – being almost irredeemably stupid – cannot."
