    "\n",
    "After a whirlwind introduction to Python you've made it to the first checkpoint. This isn't about us checking up on you, but rather about you having a chance to check your _own_ understanding of the foundational concepts covered so far. It is really _easy_ to click through the coding cells, become a bit flummoxed, look at the answer quickly 'just to check', and then come away with the impression that you've _understood_ what you are doing: \"Yeah, yeah, I made a little mistake there but it's fine because I was close enough...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We _know_ that's the case because we've _done_ it before you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with coding is that, as the code becomes more complex, so do the issues. And if you haven't learned to be careful with the basics and to _fix them yourself_ then fixing the more subtle 'mistakes' will be _that much harder_. And you don't want this to be any harder than it alreay is!"

    "### Remember: You _Will_ Make Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone makes mistakes. We do it all the time because, in programming, it is very easy to make errors. Computers are stupid and do _exactly_ what we tell them, so even tiny mistakes (`aVariable` vs `avariable`, for example) can cause a piece of code or a program to fail to run. Errors in a program are often called bugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: the [origin of the term bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#:~:text=The%20term%20%22bug%22%20was%20used,in%20an%20early%20electromechanical%20computer.&text=Operators%20traced%20an%20error%20in,taped%20to%20the%20log%20book.) was an _actual_ bug (a moth) caught up in the mechanical relay of an early computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs today are rarely of the insectile variety, and we now distinguish between three general types of error: \n",
    "1. **Syntax errors** are when the ‘grammar’ rules of Python (known as the syntax) have been violated, making it impossible for the code to be parsed (i.e. understood by Python); \n",
    "2. **Logic errors** have good syntax but there is an error in the order of statements or how they relate to one another;\n",
    "3. **Semantic errors** make programs do something other than what the programmer intended.\n",
    "Actually, not all programmers would distinguish between \\#2 and \\#3, but we'll make a case for these being different beasts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a nice little video on this topic...\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Video about Types of Errors](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ToPP5UGgJUM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToPP5UGgJUM)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first learn to code, syntax errors are the most common type of error because you are still learning the 'rules' of the language: indentation, the difference between `=` and `==`, the need for a colon (`:`) on the end of some types of code... Python is _fairly_ good at telling you what has caused a syntax error when it's trivial and happens on a single line of code, but it will get quite a bit harder as your code becomes more complex!\n",
    "\n",
    "The other types of errors are ones that you learn to spot over time through experience and developing skills. Learning to spot logic errors is one of those wonderful transferrable skills that you can _also_ use in everyday life: by learning to think through challenges at a higher level and then address them iteratively you are likely to become both a more careful thinker (i.e. _how_ should I go about solving this issue?), and a more flexible and resilient thinker (i.e. ok, so _that_ didn't work out as I expected, what should do I do now?). \n",
    "\n",
    "> _“A good example of a logic error might be, 'take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the bottle.'”_ Severance (2014, p.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sites don't even discuss the concept of a semantic error or treat it as the equivalent of a logic error, but we think it's useful to set a bar _beyond_ 'basic' logic errors: these arise from _interactions_ between parts of a program, or between a programming language and the underlying computer/operating system. So the code can (and usually does) run successfully but the output is a long way from what you expected, or the failures that you're seeing _don't make sense_. We'd suggest that spotting semantic errors is a sign that you are well on your way to _thinking_ computationally. In short, you understand why your code is triggering strange and unexpected behaviour even though it _looks_ like it should do exactly what you intended. "
