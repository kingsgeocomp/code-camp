In this lesson we cover the concept of *iteration*, which is basically the idea of *repeating the same set of instructions until a certain condition is met* (i.e. you repeat an action until you hit a given number of times). This sequence of instructions is also called a *loop*.   \n",

    "- Then we used the `while` statement to check if the value of `counter` was less then 10. \n",

So the first time that we hit it, `counter` has value of 1, but the second...it will be equal to 2, as we increased its value in the while *block* and then jumped back to the beginning of the block.

There's a good [SO Answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3294899), but the reason *very broadly speaking* is that Python's default iteration happens over the *keys* (compared to other languages which might iterate over the *values*). Hence, to get the *values* you need to use this additional method (note that in Python 3 this will be simply `items()`).\n",
